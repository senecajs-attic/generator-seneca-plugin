### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. It's a person with feelings and opinions, but it's very easy to work with.
 If you think it's too opinionated, it can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends,
 [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
